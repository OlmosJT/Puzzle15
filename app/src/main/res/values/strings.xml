        \n\nHow to Play:\n\nGame of Fifteen is a classic combination puzzle.
        Originally called Gem Puzzle, it was a wooden box with 15 numbered tiles.
        The goal of Fifteen Puzzle is to arrange the tiles from 1 to 15 by sliding them
        one by one into the empty space on the board.
        The puzzle is considered solved when tile 1 is in the top left corner, tile 2 is to the right of it,
        and so on, with the empty space on the bottom right.
        To move a tile into the empty space, you can click or touch on it, or tap to the playing area.
        Tiles can only move vertically or horizontally.
